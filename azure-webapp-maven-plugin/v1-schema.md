      <imageName>[hub-user/]repo-name[:tag]</imageName>

    `tag` is optional for the `imageName`. The default value is latest. Public docker hubs and private container registries are both supported.


#### Deployment settings

  There are multiple deployment types are supported:
    
- ZIP Deploy
    
  ZIP deploy is intended for fast and easy deployments.
  ```xml
  <configuration>
  ...
    <deploymentType>zip</deploymentType>
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory>${project.basedir}/target</directory>
        <includes>
          <include>*.jar</include>
        </includes>
        <excludes>
          <exclude>*.xml</exclude>
        </excludes>
      </resource>
    </resources>
  </configuration>
  ```
- WAR Deploy
    
  Both `<warFile>` and `<path>` are optional. By default it will find the war file according to the `<finalName>` in the  project build directory, and deploy to ROOT.
  ```xml
  <configuration>
  ...
    <deploymentType>war</deploymentType>
    <warFile></warFile>
    <path></path>
  </configuration>
  ```
- JAR Deploy
    
  `<jarFile>` is not required. If not specified, it will deploy the `${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}.jar` to `%HOME%\site\wwwroot\` of your Web App. 
  > Please note that for Windows Web App, we will generate a `web.config` file, you can find more details [here](../docs/web-config.md).
  ```xml
  <configuration>
    ...
    <deploymentType>jar</deploymentType>
    <jarFile></jarFile>
  </configuration>
  ```
    
- AUTO Deploy

  This is the default deployment type used by the plugin. It will inspect `<packaging>` field in the pom file to decide how to deploy the artifact. If the `<packaging>` is set to `war`, the plugin will use war deployment. If the `<packaging>` is set to `jar`, the plugin will use jar deployment. Otherwise, the plugin will skip the deployment, which is the same as `NONE` deployment.

  If you want the plugin to inspect the `<packaging>` field. Just don't set `<deploymentType>`. The plugin will use `AUTO` deployment as default.
    
- FTP
 
  You can deploy your artifacts/resources to Web App via FTP.
  ```xml
  <configuration>
    ...
    <deploymentType>ftp</deploymentType>
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory>${project.basedir}/target</directory>
        <includes>
          <include>*.jar</include>
        </includes>
        <excludes>
          <exclude>*.xml</exclude>
        </excludes>
      </resource>
    </resources>
  </configuration>
  ```
